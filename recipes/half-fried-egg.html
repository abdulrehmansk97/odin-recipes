    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A half fried egg, also known as a sunny side up egg, is a simple and
      classic breakfast dish. It involves cooking an egg just until the whites
      are set and the yolk remains runny. It is quick, easy to make, and pairs
      well with toast, salads, or as a topping on various dishes.
