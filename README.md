# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a simple website that showcases various recipes. The purpose of this project is to practice the fundamentals of HTML and to understand its semantic elements. No CSS or JavaScript is used in this project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of an index page that links to different recipe pages. Each recipe page includes:

- A title
- A description
- An ingredients list
- Steps for preparing the recipe

## File Structure

```
odin-recipes/
├── index.html
├── recipe1.html
├── recipe2.html
└── recipe3.html
```

- `index.html`: The homepage of the website, containing links to all recipe pages.
- `recipe1.html`, `recipe2.html`, `recipe3.html`: Individual pages for each recipe.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. From there, you can navigate to each recipe page by clicking on the respective links.

## Lessons Learned

This project emphasizes the importance of HTML semantics, including the use of:

- `<header>`: Represents introductory content.
- `<nav>`: Contains navigation links.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
- `<section>`: Groups related content.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings.
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph.
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Represent lists.
- `<a>`: Defines hyperlinks.
